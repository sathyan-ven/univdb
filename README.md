univdb
======

A sample MSSQL database of students' profile and university preference from a famous educational forum. This database contains two tables:

1) A user table which has over 9K records and gives information on the user's current university, program, major, specialization, GRE and TOEFL scores, undergraduate details and profile (employment, research etc. if provided)

2) User's university preference table. This table lists the universities to which the user applied and gives all additional details provided by the user like, the result (accepted/rejected), comments based on user's obesevation etc. (approx. 40K records)

I have provided here the zipped version of SQL script. Just the provided script in SQL Management Studio or you can easily modify the script to import into any other database like MySQL.

Note:
This database is only for getting an idea of admission trends and student profiles in recent years. There are no personal information in this database.
